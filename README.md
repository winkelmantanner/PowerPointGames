# PowerPointGames
When I was 10-14 years of age I enjoyed making games in Microsoft PowerPoint.  Some of them were quite impressive, so I am posting them here.

There are some things in these PowerPoints that I cannot create or edit in my newer version of PowerPoint running on my Mac.  But the old PowerPoints still run.

Download a PowerPoint file, then play the first slide to play the game.

Description: An adventure with several boss battles.

Time to beat: 1 hour.

Requirements: Mouse or touchpad with which you are extremely comfortable.

Notes: I disabled right clicking, mouse dissapearing, and other problematic default behavior when I made this game all those years ago.  The only way I know to exit is the escape button.
